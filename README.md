The store-simulator project is a console-based C++ program that prompts the user to input items that they would like to stock a store with, then allows them to select and purchase items from their newly created store.

## Usage

To run the store-simulator, follow the steps below:
1. **Clone project to the desired local environment.**
2. **Build a C++ project using the files held within the repository.**
3. **Add filepath to the `include` directory to additional include directories recognized by the compiler.** In Visual Studio, this can be done by adding the directory's path to the "Additional Include Directories", which is located under your solution's Property Pages->Configuration Properties->C/C++.

## Motivation

I developed this project as a simple method of testing the knowledge I gained from learning C++ via online tutorials. The project was meant to require a knowledge of a wide range of different C++ concepts a strong grasp on object-oriented design. I developed this project within Visual Studio 2019, primarily working in October of 2020.
